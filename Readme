|Purpose|
Purpose of this repository is to learn infrastructure tools to create simple internet web application that reports server stats(memory, cpu, ...).

|How to setup enviornment|
It's very simple. We will use vagrant to define what type of virtual machine we want. I will use Ubuntu 12.04 x64 in this repository.

First install this software:
1) Oracle Virtual Box ( Version >= 4.3.20).
    -> It's free and open source product. Vagrant uses virtual box to create virtual OS defined in vagrant configuratin file.
    
2) Vagrant ( Version >= 1.7.1)

Note: Version does not have to be as defined. Benefit of using defined version is that I will using defined versions as I work on this repository. Please feel free to add different version if you have test it out.
